A Python-based tool to automate the extraction and classification of tax documents (W-9, W-8BEN, CRS self-certifications) for regulatory compliance (FATCA/CRS). Reduces manual effort by 30% and improves accuracy in tax form processing.

---

## Features
- **Document Classification**: Automatically categorizes tax forms (W-9, W-8BEN, CRS) using NLP.
- **Data Extraction**: Parses key fields (TIN, Entity Type, Country of Tax Residence) from PDFs.
- **Validation Checks**: Flags missing/invalid entries against FATCA/CRS rules.
- **CSV/Excel Export**: Generates structured reports for compliance teams.

## Tech Stack
- **Python Libraries**: `PyPDF2`, `spaCy/NLTK`, `pandas`, `regex`
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (optional UI for non-technical users)
- **Database**: SQLite (stores processed documents for audit trails)

## Installation
